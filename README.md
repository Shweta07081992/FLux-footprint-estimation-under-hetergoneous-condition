## Sensitivity of analytical flux footprint models in diverse source-receptor configurations: A Field experimental study
This README file describes the data used in the study that are obtained for EC flux tower. Raw data at 10 Hz frequency obtained from three synchronized EC towers were analyzed to estimate the fluxes using EddyPro software, version 6.2.1.

**EC flux System Components**
3D sonic anemometer,
One open-path fast response infrared gas analyzer (IRGASON-EB-IC, Campbell Sci. Inc., USA),
logger (CR3000, Campbell Sci.Inc., USA)

# List of Experiments
The field experiments took place from 15 Aug - 30 Sep 2018 and we conducted the following experiments. All the experimental data are kept in .csv file and .dat file in the respective folders named corresponding to the following experiments
Experiment 1: Experimental validation of analytical models
This experiment was focused on evaluation of experimental footprints releasing the tracer from six locations (40m, 30m, 20m, 15m, 10m, and 5m) upwind of the measurement station. A reference EC system was kept at 5m upwind of the line source to represent the natural environmental condition.

Experiment 2:We conducted this experiment to study effect of a)	Variable emission height: In this setup, for each placement of the line source (at 40m, 30m, 20m, 15m, 10m, and 5 m upwind of the fixed towers), the tracer is emitted from three levels (ground level (GL), 0.5m, and 1m above GL).  For all the cases, EC fluxes were observed at two measurement heights (1.5m and 2.8m).
b)	Variable source length: In this setup, for each placement of the release location (40m, 30m, 20m, 15m, 10m, and 5m upwind of the fixed towers), the tracer is emitted from the GL with three source lengths (Î”x = 0.5m, 1.0m, 3.6m). An intermediate mobile tower placed at 20m from the mast was used for additional validation.

Experiment 3:We monitored the fluxes at two measurement heights (zm=1.5m and 2.8m) by gradually changing the source-receptor distance from -5m to 40m.

Experiment 4:We conducted this experiment to study effect of Variable offset from mean wind direction: In this setup, the mobile tower located at 40m from the source was moved laterally from the centerline to make different offset angles with mean wind direction. A reference tower placed at 5m upwind of the mast was used to monitor the environmental CO2 concentration.
The Supplementary file contains the data and plots that clearly shows the CO2 emission concentration and  durations of the tracer duration detected by EC the flux systems.

EC_flux _tower _data(1508-3009) contains all the micrometerological dataset observed during the entire experimental period 15 Aug-30 Sep.
